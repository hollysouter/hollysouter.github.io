## In Class Barchart Example
This is a barchart created using ChartBuilder that represents the percentages of students in each of Lehigh's undergraduate colleges in 2021. It shows that in 2021 arts and sciences was the most popular college with 37% undergraduate students enrolled. The chart also conveys that there is a very small amount of students enrolled in the college of health and arts/engineering with 1.7% and 1.1% undergraduate students enrolled respectively in each. The data collected represents 5,451 total students and this data is from the [Office of Institutional Research & Strategy Anslydid](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2021.pdf).

## Spotify Streams 2021 Barchart
This is a barchart created using ChartBuilder that shows that most streamed spotify artists globally in 2021. The artists were ranked based on the number of streams, or number of times their songs were played, in billions. Bad Bunny had the most amount of streams with 10.1 billion in 2021, with Taylor Swift coming in second with exactly one billion less streams. The data collected represents all of Spotify users globally and this data comes from [Spotify.](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-01/what-the-world-streamed-most-in-2021/)

## In Class Time-series Chart
This is a time-series chart that represents the percentages of students in each of Lehigh's three undergraduate colleges over the past ten years. Using ChartBuilder this visualization shows that engineering has undergone a decline in undergraduate enrollment from 2016 to 2022, while arts and sciences has faced an increase in enrollment since 2016. Business has been very steady throughout the last seven years experiencing a slight increase and decrease throughout the years. This data collected comes from Lehigh's [institutional profile.](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/university-profile)

## In Class Scatter Plot Chart
This is a scatter plot created using ChartBuilder. The graph compares a country's GPD per capita to their life statisfaction ranking. The graph shows that for the most part there is a positive correlation between the two categories, meaning that the higher a country's GDP per capita is the more likely the country's life satisfaction will be higher as well. This data was collected from [WorldBank.](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction).

## Ivy League Time-series Chart
This is a time-series chart created using ChartBuilder. The graph represents the changing acceptance rates of three of America's most prestigious universities. From this time-series chart it can be seen that Harvard always held the lowest acceptance rate throughout all of the years. It is also can be seen that between the year 2018 and 2019 Princeton had a larger decrease compared to the other universities. For all three universities there was a dramatic decrease in acceptance rate from the year 2021 to 2022. This information can all be seen in the graphic below.![What are the acceptance rates of Harvard, Princeton, and Yale over the past years?](https://github.com/hollysouter/hollysouter.github.io/blob/main/Acceptance-Rates-for-Harvard,-Yale,-and-Princeton-over-the-Years-Harvard-Yale-Princeton-chartbuilder-2.png?raw=true)


## In Class Map Activity 
This is an interactive map created using Google My Maps. The map displays the top 20 cycling cities around the world. From this map it can be seen that most of the popular cycling cities are in Europe, with a few outliers in Canada, Japan and Columbia. This information used in the map was collected from [Wired.](https://www.wired.com/story/most-bike-friendly-cities-2019-copenhagenize-design-index/)

## Best Fall Foliage Map 
This visualization is an interactive map created using Google My Maps. I was inspired to create this map because of the fall foliage that is happening on campus right now and was curious to see where in our country has the prettiest foliage to see. It is interesting to see that the majority of the best places are located along the east coast, with New England being a very popular place to see the best foliage. There were no locations in the top 10 places to see foliage that were in the midwest or southwest, and only two locations in the west. It is safe to assume that if you are looking to see the best foliage head to New England for the fall months. The information collected to create this map can be found from [Attractions of America.](https://www.attractionsofamerica.com/thingstodo/fall-colors.php)

## In Class Tableau Practice 
This is an interactive barchart that shows the difference in gender preferences for a party setting at Lehigh. From the data it is interesting to note that majority of females prefer off campus parties while males prefer parties on the hill, maybe this was a conclusion for the data because some males live at the houses on the hill and it is more convenient for them to have a party there. The barchart also shows that more females have the opinion of no preference compared to the males, showing that maybe males care more in general about where the party is being held. The data collected from this barchart can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M3fvI1f7l4QP_zvlo5YA405N-6oZXp8SA1btxvsUyeI/edit#gid=638165819)

## Interactive Data Visualization 
This visualization shows the various causes of deaths throughout the United States. This visualization allows viewers to filter through different states in order to either compare states side by side or to just view a single state on its own. This graph displays the 10 leading causes of deaths in the U.S and it is pretty presistent that heart disease and cancer tend to be the top causes of death in each state. The data is from 2017 and can be found [here.](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-leading-causes-of-death-united-states.)
